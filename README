README

DhMakePerl is the CPAN version of a debian tool used to create debian
packages from CPAN modules. DhMakePerl is currently a bit for bit copy 
of dh-make-perl which is available on debian and debian-like systems 
with the command of;

     aptitude install dh-make-perl

You can get the source of dh-make-perl with;

    aptitude source dh-make-perl

The debian perl team strives to remain up-to-date with the native 
debian code that this module was created from, but there is no 
gaurantee of this. Please check the following sources for more 
up-to-date software:

PURPOSE 

The purpose of this software is to create debian packages from 
perl modules. From the dh-make-perl README file:

"dh-make-perl will create the files required to build
a debian source package out of a perl package.
This works for most simple packages and is also useful
for getting started with packaging perl modules for debian.

There is an override mechanism in place to handle most of
the little changes that may be needed for some modules
(this hasn't been tested much, though).

Using this program is no substiture for reading the
debian developer documentation, including the policy,
the perl policy, the packaging manual and so on."
